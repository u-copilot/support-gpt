 To determine the number of downlights required to achieve 500 lux in all corners of a 1000 sqft classroom with an 8 ft ceiling height, we need to calculate the total lumens required and then determine how many downlights with their specific lumen output can provide that amount.

First, let's calculate the total lumens required:

1. Determine the foot-candle (fc) requirement: 500 lux = 53.96 fc
2. Convert the area from square feet to square meters: 1000 sqft = 92.903 sqm
3. Calculate the total lumens required: Lumens = fc * Area * 10.76

Using the given formula, the total lumens required is approximately 53,960 lumens.

Now, let's determine how many downlights are needed based on the provided context:

1. The context does not provide enough information about the specific lumen output of the downlights.
2. To find the number of downlights, we would need to know the lumen output of a single downlight and the distribution pattern (e.g., 75º beam angle).
3. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the exact number of downlights required to achieve 500 lux in all corners of a 1000 sqft classroom with an 8 ft ceiling height based on the provided context.
